# Machine-learning
I created a single neural network.First i defined sigmoid function which is used to find the probabilty.Then i calculated the sigmoid derivative which is used to find the adjustment.The training output is the actual answer to which i want to bring my result to.Then weights are generated using the random function and then the output is calculated using z=w.Tx+b.Now,we want to bring it close to the actual answer.So,we find the sigmoid derivative and multiply it with the error and then add the dot product of it to weights.Now when we find the output it gets close to actual answer.As,we increase the number of iterations the answer gets closer to actual output.
